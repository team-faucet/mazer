# Mazer

## Game Idea
You walk in a procedurally generated maze while only being able to see the room you are currently in and where the goal on the map is located. You have to carry all coins to the goal, but you can only hold 1 at a time.

## Story
You are a miner and your village desperatly needs your help. It is out of money after a raid and the gold from the mine is the only thing that can save them. Sadly, nearly all of the people that go into the mines get lost - except for you! You are the only one with enough mental strength and coordination to neither loose your mind nor your sense of direction.
